# Shadcn → Figma (One-Click Design System Import)

Bring the full **shadcn/ui design system** into Figma in a single click.  
This plugin instantly generates variables, colors, typography, radii, spacing, and all core tokens—plus fully structured component sets—directly inside your Figma file.

Designers get the entire system *ready in seconds*, no setup, no manual rebuilding, no hunting through docs.

## ✨ What This Plugin Does

- Imports the **full shadcn/ui design system** into Figma automatically  
- Generates **Variables** (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows)
- Creates **Component Sets** structured exactly like shadcn/ui
- Sets up **separate Figma pages** for:
  - Tokens & Variables  
  - Base Components  
  - Component Variants  
  - Patterns & Layouts
- Ensures pixel-perfect mapping between shadcn/ui and Figma
- Designed for both designers and frontend teams using shadcn/ui

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Setting up a design system manually takes hours.  
Importing shadcn/ui into Figma used to require:
- Rebuilding tokens by hand  
- Manually converting Tailwind values  
- Creating variants one by one  
- Keeping everything synced with code  

This plugin removes all of that friction.  
Click once → the entire system appears ready to design with.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Run the plugin in any Figma file  
2. Choose the shadcn/ui preset (default)  
3. The plugin generates:
   - Figma Variables
   - Component sets
   - Auto-organized pages
4. Start designing immediately with consistent system components
